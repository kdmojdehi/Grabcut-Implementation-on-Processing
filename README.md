# Grabcut Implementation on Processing

Implementation of Grabcut algorithm using the Processing platform. Details of the algorithm including citation as well as implementation details can be found in report file.

**Note:** This code uses PGrabcut processing library ( which is a GraphCut class java implementation by Boykov, along with Matrix Library for JAVA (JAMA)).
You need to import this library in your processing environemnt. In order to do so, copy and paste the folder inside libraries into
your processing path (default on windows: "Documents/Processing/libraries/" )



BoykovGrpahcut.py is just for demonstration of mincut/maxflow implementation (written by myself) and is not a part of the project's main program.
